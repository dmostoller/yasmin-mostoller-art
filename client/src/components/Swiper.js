                My name is Yasmin Mostoller, and Iâ€™m eager to share my art with the world, offering a unique vision of the galaxy's beauty through abstract expression. As a painter, I draw inspiration from the natural world's profound beauty and the mysteries it holds.

            My work explores the intricate relationship between light, shadow, and atmosphere, using vibrant color, form, and texture to create immersive, multi-dimensional experiences. Whether timeless and elegant or modern and chaotic, the galaxy demands to be explored in all its facets.

            I layer paint meticulously to produce highly textured, three-dimensional pieces on canvas and paper. The colors, textures, and enigmatic qualities of the galaxy, its stars, planets, and celestial bodies serve as my primary inspiration.

            I believe in the power of creativity, imagination, and self-expression. Art, to me, has the potential to convey profound truths about our universe and humanity. It can evoke memories, transport us to new realms of thought and feeling, and offer fresh perspectives.

            Through my paintings, I seek to capture the moments that resonate with me, allowing imagination and emotion to shape my vibrant abstract creations.
